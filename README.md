React Component Library (CRA)

A reusable React + TypeScript component library built with Create React App, Storybook, and Docker.
This project demonstrates a complete UI component workflow from development to containerized deployment.

Project Overview:

This project includes reusable UI components such as:

Button
Label
Text
Dropdown
RadioButton
Img
HeroImage
Card
Table (with Row, Header, Cell, Footer)
Each component follows a consistent 5-file structure for scalability and maintainability.

Component Structure (Important):

Every component contains five files:

ComponentName/
├── ComponentName.tsx        # Component implementation
├── ComponentName.types.ts   # TypeScript interfaces
├── ComponentName.index.ts
├── ComponentName.stories.tsx # Storybook stories
└── ComponentName.test.tsx   # Unit tests
